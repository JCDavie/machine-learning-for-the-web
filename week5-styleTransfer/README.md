# Week 5 Image Transfermation - Style Transfer

## Presentation: [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QJumvGwCzErFJFva2LnqNLUmIDp_uz83fPWC6iCR3l0/edit?usp=sharing)
- What is Style Transfer
- How does it work
- What Neural Networks See
- Different kinds of style transfer
- How to train your own style transfer
- Use the trained model in ml5.js (one image and webcam images)

## Coding session:
- Training a new Style Transfer model, Run this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TZNdhoUEBoxQqY5EFloZcuyYUs9oNQ-g?usp=sharing).
- Running Style Transfer model in ml5.js, [p5 sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/yining/sketches/1DBFHwte2)
